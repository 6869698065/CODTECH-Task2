## **Overview of the Project**                                                                                                                                              
### **Project**: UART(UNIVERSAL ASYNCHRONOUS RECEIVER TRANSMITTER) DESIGN                                                                                                                                  
### *Objective*                                                                                                                                                                                                        The objective of this project is to design, implement, and verify a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) module using Verilog in a VLSI software environment. The project aims to develop both the transmitter and receiver parts of the UART module, simulate their functionality, verify the design using waveform analysis, and emulate UART communication through VLSI software.
